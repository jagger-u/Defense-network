Here are the steps:
1. Create scenery.
	1.1 Gravity
	1.2 Floating effect
	1.3 Color
	1.4 Flexibiliy: control float, color, barriers, size
2. Add proteins.
	2.1 Shape of proteins
	2.2 Two pieces attached
	2.3 Separation of the two pieces
	2.4 Movement of protein 











Remarks:
	1. You know Biology is interesting. It has color. I like it. 
	2. Also learning to investigate systems is a cool skill to have.

Goals:
	1. Create a simulation					(starting and finishing a project)
	2. Show how a system behaves				(applying domain knowledge)
	3. Learn some ways to apply rules to a system			(using algorithms)
Simulation: Defense network. Immune system. Complement system.
Scenarios:
	1. Person with low immune system vs. high immune system
	2. Bacteria, Virus
	3. More advanced virus functions.
Roles:
	1. Protein:
		1.0 C3
		1.1 C3a
		1.2 C3b
		1.3 C3 Con
		1.4 MAC folks
	2. Immune cells
		2.1 Phagocytes
	3. Bacteria
Time evolution:
	0. Protein drift randomly. Phagocytes are dormant.
	1. Bacteria enters.
	2. C3 triggered. C3 breaks into C3a, C3b
	3. C3a floods away to bring the Phagocytes. Phagocytes awake and travel towards the site.
	4. C3b targets bacteria. Cripples them. Change shape and trigger other proteins.
	5. Phagocytes swallow bacteria and destroy them.
	6. MAC folks rip a hole in bacteria and destroy them.



1. You cut yourself. Bacteria enters.
2. Mindless protein drift randomly. Until activated. C3 is the first match. It activates somehow (no details here).
	2.1. C3 breaks into two smaller proteins. C3a, C3b
	2.2. C3b
		2.2.1 Seeker missile: bacteria, fungi, viruses.
		2.2.2 Fraction of a second to find a victim or will be neutralized by water molecules.
		2.2.3 If it finds a target, it anchors itself tightly. 
		2.2.4 Changes shape, attaches with another incoming protein. Change shape change shape.
		2.2.5 Finally it transforms into a recruiting platform: C3 Convertase.
		2.2.6 This activates other proteins. 
	2.3. Soon 1000s of proteins cover the bacteria.
		2.3.1 Bacteria slows down.
	2.4. C3a
		2.4.1 Flood away from battle field and SCREAM for attention.
		2.4.2 Passive immune cells notice. And follow the protein tracks to the site.
		2.4.3 The more alarms they get, the more aggressive they become.
Kill bacteria	**2.4.4 The first immune cells to arrive at the battlefield are phagocytes. 
			2.4.4.1 These swallow you whole. Trap. Kill with acid.
			2.4.4.2 To grab them, the PROTEINS help.
	2.5. Membrane attack complex
		2.5.1 C3 Convertase changes its shape again. Recruits new proteins. 
Kill bacteria	**2.5.2 They rip a hole in the bacteria that cannot be closed again.
	2.6. And there's more.
